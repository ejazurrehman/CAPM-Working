CAPM Calculation – Python Exercise\
Overview:
- This project demonstrates the calculation of a stock’s expected return using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
- We process historical stock and market return data, compute Beta, and apply the CAPM formula with a given risk-free rate to estimate the expected return.

Data Inputs:
- File Name: data.csv
- Columns Required:
- DATE – Date of the observation
- Return_Stock – Stock’s daily returns (as decimals, e.g., 0.005 for 0.5%)
- Return_Market – Market index daily returns (as decimals)
- Risk-Free Rate (Rf): Given as 10.095% (annualized)
